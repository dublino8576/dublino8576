## Welcome to my profile!!!! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full Stack Web Developer who graduated from Javascript Northcoders Bootcamp in March 2025.

Throughout the course, I have managed to deliver a pretty good range of projects, building two RESTful APIs: NC News & Habigotchi,
which have respective apps built with React & React Native

Let me know if you need more help to make the repos work!!
